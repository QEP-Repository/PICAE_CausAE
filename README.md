## 🔹 PIC-AE — Physics-Informed Constrained Autoencoder

PIC-AE is designed for:
- System identification from partial/noisy measurements  
- State reconstruction using proxy variables  
- Latent dynamics discovery with physics-based constraints  
- Optional self-modeling of unknown physical parameters  

📄 A complete description, setup instructions, and dataset details are provided in:
> `PICAE/README.md`

## 🔸 CausAE — Causality Autoencoder

CausAE focuses on:
- Detecting and quantifying causal relationships between variables  
- Learning time-lagged latent-state dynamics  
- Using ensemble performance comparison as a causality metric  

📄 Usage instructions and methodology are documented in:
> `CausAE/README.md`
